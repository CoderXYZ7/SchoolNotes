Nikola Tesla, born on July 10th, 1856, in Smiljan, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and now located in Serbia, was the fourth child among five born to Milutin Tesla and Djuka Mandiche. His early years in Smiljan were marked by the expectation that he would follow his father's professional path. However, even in his earliest schooling, his aptitude for mathematics and science set him apart.

At the age of seven, Tesla's family relocated to the nearby town of Gospic. Despite familiar expectations, his fascination with mathematics and science only intensified. Eventually, he pursued higher education in Austria, enrolling at the Polytechnic of Graz. There, he delved into Electrical and Mechanical Engineering, as well as mathematics and physics.

Throughout his educational and professional journey, Tesla faced significant health challenges, including contracting cholera at the age of 17 and experiencing neurological issues that manifested as vivid flashes and hallucinations. Despite these setbacks, his determination never wavered.

It was during his time in Graz that Tesla first encountered a direct current generator, sparking his lifelong passion for electricity. In 1881, he officially embarked on his career as an electrical engineer, fully dedicating himself to the study and exploration of electrical phenomena.

Tesla's pivotal moments of insight often coincided with personal trials. During his time in Budapest, while grappling with health issues, he conceptualized the use of a rotating magnetic field for electric motors powered by alternating current, a breakthrough that would revolutionize electrical power systems.

His subsequent moves to Paris and then to the United States marked periods of both professional growth and personal struggle. Despite early promise at Edison Machine Works, disagreements with Thomas Edison ultimately led to disappointment. Nevertheless, Tesla's departure from Edison's company catalyzed his independent pursuit of innovation.

After parting ways with Edison, Nikola Tesla went on to establish his own laboratory and work on numerous projects, including the development of the alternating current (AC) electrical system. He secured patents for inventions such as the Tesla coil and the induction motor, contributing significantly to the advancement of electrical engineering. Despite facing financial difficulties later in life, Tesla continued his research until his death in 1943.
