Neighbors
Well, I don't really have any neighbor, i live in house on the out skirts of San Giorgio, so the only living things that i see are the ducks and the nutrias.
Where i live i have the river on one side of the house, the main street on the opposite one, and on the other two, a white road and a field.
On the other side of the main street there are some houses, but half of them are empty and we don't have a lot of relations with the ones who live in the other half, beside one family, because they have 2 children that are friends with my little sister.
We never bonded with the neighbors for more than one reason, to start, my parents come, one from the other side of San Giorgio and the other one from a near town, and than there is the question of the house, because they bought the house from 4 brothers, it was abandoned, and before them a lot of our neighbors tried to buy the land, without success, because the brother weren’t in accord on the price.
