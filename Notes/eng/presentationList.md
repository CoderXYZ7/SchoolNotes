# Guidelines for Presentation

## 1. Chose the style of presentation according to the topic and the audience

There are styles that better fit specific topics, and you should choose the medium that best fits the audience.

## 2. Be as professional as needed

You should be professional if the situation needs it, but sometimes you can be more casual if you want to play more on the empathy of the audience.

## 3. Be clear, don't leave loose ends, unless you have a reason to do so

Leaving loose ends can make the audience confused and leaves you exposed to possible attacks, the only reason to do so is if you WANT to be attacked, and this can be a double edged sword.

## 4. Use visual aids to support your presentation

People these days are used to watch, not read, so use visual aids to support your presentation.

## 5. Practice a lot

Practice practice practice, but don't overdo it, if you become too confident and memorize the content you'll do errors.
