Transforming an underutilized school park into vibrant, multifunctional spaces can significantly enhance the educational environment and foster community engagement. By integrating concepts from innovative educational institutions and incorporating versatile recreational facilities, the school can create areas that promote learning, physical activity, and social interaction.

## Green School Concept

Drawing inspiration from the Green School in Bali, the park can be developed to embody sustainability and environmental consciousness. Green Schools are institutions that adopt a comprehensive approach to Education for Sustainable Development (ESD), addressing climate change through teaching, facilities, operations, governance, and community partnerships. Implementing this concept involves designing outdoor classrooms and learning spaces that utilize natural materials and renewable energy sources. Such an environment not only supports academic growth but also instills a sense of responsibility towards the planet among students.

## Outdoor Fitness Park

Incorporating an outdoor fitness area aligns with the goal of promoting physical well-being within the school community. Companies like NOORD specialize in creating aesthetic, weatherproof, and functional outdoor fitness equipment. Their designs are tailored for minimal maintenance and can be customized in various colors to complement the school's aesthetic. Integrating such equipment encourages regular physical activity, fosters social interaction, and enhances the overall appeal of the school grounds.

## Table Games Space/Library

Establishing a dedicated area for table games and a library within the park offers students opportunities for leisure, learning, and socialization. This space can serve as a hub for intellectual and recreational activities, providing access to a diverse range of books and games that cater to various interests and age groups. Such an initiative supports cognitive development, encourages collaboration, and enriches the cultural fabric of the school community.

## Implementation Considerations

To effectively develop these spaces, collaboration with experts in sustainable design, outdoor fitness, and educational facility planning is essential. Engaging with professionals ensures that the designs are both functional and aligned with the school's educational objectives. Additionally, involving students, staff, and the local community in the planning process fosters a sense of ownership and ensures that the spaces meet the diverse needs of all stakeholders.

## Conclusion

Revamping the school's unused park space by incorporating elements inspired by the Green School concept, outdoor fitness facilities, and recreational areas like a table games space/library can significantly enrich the educational experience. These enhancements promote sustainability, physical health, and intellectual growth, creating a dynamic environment that supports the holistic development of students and strengthens community bonds.
